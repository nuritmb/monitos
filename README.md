# Basically, I am monkey

Things to consider:

- Number of monkeys
- Benefit of following the convention vs. not following it
- Run simulation with different number of signals and actions
- Do monkeys need to learn individually how to talk, or just as a group? Also, how to measure difference between one and the other?
- What happens when we take probabilistic wordmaps and actionmaps?

Investigate:

- What happens when we add structure and compositionality? Also, what is the best way to do this?

Benchmarks:

- What conditions have to be fulfilled in order for a coordinated wordmap and actionmap convention to be *likely*?
